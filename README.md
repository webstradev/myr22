# Mid Year Review: Erik Westra - Software Engineer
It has been a very hectic 6 months, and early in the year my focus shifted away from the feature development and was heavily aimed towards testing, documentation, testability and Operation Excellence. This lead to a lot of feature development being delayed or put on hold. 

I struggled to work on any of my own development/skill growth (for example AWS) due to the shifted focus. 

A lot of effort was put into assisting and advising Almer in designing the SOPs for our software development lifecycle, bug reporting, issue management and software releases.

### Goals we set in December 2021 :checkered_flag::
:heavy_check_mark:Activity Monitoring System on the dashboard.  

:heavy_check_mark:Push project management to the next level, with JIRA tickets, documentation and releases.

:heavy_check_mark:Research which aspects of the Microservice Architecture might benefit our infrastructure.

:interrobang: Knowledge boost on Docker & Kubernetes.

:x:Mentor one or two interns for the Tech Team.

:x:AWS Developer Certification.

<hr/>

### What did I learn? :books:
:green_book: Gained a lot of knowledge and experience around testing in Go, making our code base more testable, mocking and deploying tests, advanced testing patterns and optimizing the testing experience with reusable testing functions and abstractions. This led to the neurokeys-api now having a pretty solid foundation for building unit tests.

:green_book: In terms of documentation and "Operational Excellence", a lot of ground was covered with setting up the foundation for a better documentation system in terms of client-facing and internal developer documentation, traceability and release management. I spent time researching some of these topic for best practices in other tech companies and listened to various podcasts to get a good image of what is common and how it might apply to Neurocast.

:green_book: Building API's in python allowing us to set up a good first iteration for the control of the MATT robot.

:green_book: Better communication with other teams, expectation management towards the clinical team about implementation times was a lot better the past 6 months.

<hr/>

### Important Accomplishments :sparkler:
:triangular_flag_on_post: Supported DS team with implementation of MATT.  
:triangular_flag_on_post: Built the foundation for the Testing Suite for the Neurokeys API.  
:triangular_flag_on_post: Implemented a more advanced Activity Monitoring System on the dashboard.  
:triangular_flag_on_post: Assited with the creation of Standard Operating Procedures for issue management, bug reporting, software releasing and feature requests.

### Stats :1234:
:eight::nine: Pull Requests Implementend  
:four::four::eight: Automated Unit Tests Added

### What didn't go as planned?:clock3:  
:small_red_triangle_down: Due to lack of time no progress was made with AWS Developer training other than selecting the track/certification.  
:small_red_triangle_down: Due to a change in planning, there were no interns for me to mentor.  
:small_red_triangle_down: Some of the more complex features that were discussed ended up getting pushed aside to make time for "Operational Excellence".

`A senior engineer is expected to create expert design concepts and foolproof debugging. Senior engineers can work independently compared to the aforementioned titles. They take on more complex projects and mentor junior engineers. `
